# InsuranceSuite

Insurance Suite is a wannabe configurable risk management system capable of dealing with any type of insurance. The intention is to develop a micro-service architecture in which there will be a REST API back-end which is consumed by an independent front-end. Both back-end and front-end are different independent projects. The requirements can be found [here]([https://github.com/vivekthoppil/InsuranceSuite/blob/master/BACKDROP.md](https://github.com/vivekthoppil/InsuranceSuite/blob/master/BACKDROP.md))
